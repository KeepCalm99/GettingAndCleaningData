Assignment for Getting And Cleaning Data


This is the course assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:
1.	Refers to your working directory where you would have unzipped the following file:  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2.	Loads the training and tests datasets using only the mean or standard deviation from those datasets.
3.	It also loads the activity and subject dataset for both the training and tests datasets and merges all datasets together
4.	Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file TidyData.txt.
